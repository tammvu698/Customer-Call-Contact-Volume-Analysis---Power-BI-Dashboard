Insights and Recommendation:

Insights: 
We have a total of 5000 calls. 81% of the calls are answered and 73% of those problems from the calls are solved. 
Abandoned Calls Rate: 19%. This means 19% of the calls are not picked up in the first calls or cannot reach onwards. Since this dataset does not mention the times the agent calls the customers, I will assume this rate is also the first call resolution rate.

Company Y should focus on improving the Streaming, Technical Support, and Payment-related issues. First priority should be Streaming, even though most of the cases from this issue are solved. 
Joe should be working on improving his skills on how to make customers more satisfied since he has the lowest CSAT score out of 8 agents.
