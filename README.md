# Customer-Call-Contact-Volume-Analysis---Power-BI-Dashboard

DISCLAIMER: This is the project that I took the dataset from Kaggle. This data is about Customer Call Center Data. I came up with the idea of business case scenario. 

**Case scenario**: 
In light of Company X's recent substantial growth, there is a noticeable awareness of the significance of customer retention alongside product development. The Senior Customer Delivery Manager aims to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction rates, common topics or issues prompting customer engagement with the support call center, the level of assistance provided by specific agents, and the correlation between agent performance and high customer satisfaction scores. The purpose of this dashboard is to gain deeper insights from customer call volume data and offer actionable recommendations for strategic improvements.
